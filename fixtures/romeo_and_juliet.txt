"Romeo and Juliet\nACT I\nPROLOGUE\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\nFrom forth the fatal loins of these two foes\nA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;\nWhose misadventured piteous overthrows\nDo with their death bury their parents' strife.\nThe fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,\nAnd the continuance of their parents' rage,\nWhich, but their children's end, nought could remove,\nIs now the two hours' traffic of our stage;\nThe which if you with patient ears attend,\nWhat here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.\nSCENE I. Verona. A public place.\nEnter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers\nSAMPSON\nGregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.\nGREGORY\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\nSAMPSON\nI mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.\nGREGORY\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.\nSAMPSON\nI strike quickly, being moved.\nGREGORY\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\nSAMPSON\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\nGREGORY\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:\ntherefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\nSAMPSON\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will\ntake the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\nGREGORY\nThat shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes\nto the wall.\nSAMPSON\nTrue; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\nare ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push\nMontague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids\nto the wall.\nGREGORY\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\nSAMPSON\n'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I\nhave fought with the men, I will be cruel with the\nmaids, and cut off their heads.\nGREGORY\nThe heads of the maids?\nSAMPSON\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;\ntake it in what sense thou wilt.\nGREGORY\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\nSAMPSON\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and\n'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.\nGREGORY\n'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou\nhadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes\ntwo of the house of the Montagues.\nSAMPSON\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\nGREGORY\nHow! turn thy back and run?\nSAMPSON\nFear me not.\nGREGORY\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\nSAMPSON\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\nGREGORY\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as\nthey list.\nSAMPSON\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;\nwhich is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.\nEnter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR\n\nABRAHAM\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\nSAMPSON\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\nABRAHAM\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\nSAMPSON\n[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say\nay?\nGREGORY\nNo.\nSAMPSON\nNo, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I\nbite my thumb, sir.\nGREGORY\nDo you quarrel, sir?\nABRAHAM\nQuarrel sir! no, sir.\nSAMPSON\nIf you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.\nABRAHAM\nNo better.\nSAMPSON\nWell, sir.\nGREGORY\nSay 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.\nSAMPSON\nYes, better, sir.\nABRAHAM\nYou lie.\nSAMPSON\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.\nThey fight\n\nEnter BENVOLIO\n\nBENVOLIO\nPart, fools!\nPut up your swords; you know not what you do.\nBeats down their swords\n\nEnter TYBALT\n\nTYBALT\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\nTurn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.\nBENVOLIO\nI do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\nTYBALT\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\nHave at thee, coward!\nThey fight\n\nEnter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs\n\nFirst Citizen\nClubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!\nDown with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!\nEnter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET\n\nCAPULET\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\nLADY CAPULET\nA crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?\nCAPULET\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\nEnter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE\n\nMONTAGUE\nThou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.\nLADY MONTAGUE\nThou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.\nEnter PRINCE, with Attendants\n\nPRINCE\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--\nWill they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\nThrow your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\nHave thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,\nAnd made Verona's ancient citizens\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\nCanker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time, all the rest depart away:\nYou Capulet; shall go along with me:\nAnd, Montague, come you this afternoon,\nTo know our further pleasure in this case,\nTo old Free-town, our common judgment-place.\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\nExeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO\n\nMONTAGUE\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\nBENVOLIO\nHere were the servants of your adversary,\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach:\nI drew to part them: in the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,\nWhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head and cut the winds,\nWho nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\nCame more and more and fought on part and part,\nTill the prince came, who parted either part.\nLADY MONTAGUE\nO, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\nBENVOLIO\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\nPeer'd forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\nWhere, underneath the grove of sycamore\nThat westward rooteth from the city's side,\nSo early walking did I see your son:\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood:\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\nThat most are busied when they're most alone,\nPursued my humour not pursuing his,\nAnd gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.\nMONTAGUE\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the furthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\nAway from the light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks far daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night:\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\nBENVOLIO\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\nMONTAGUE\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\nBENVOLIO\nHave you importuned him by any means?\nMONTAGUE\nBoth by myself and many other friends:\nBut he, his own affections' counsellor,\nIs to himself--I will not say how true--\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm,\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\nEnter ROMEO\n\nBENVOLIO\nSee, where he comes: so please you, step aside;\nI'll know his grievance, or be much denied.\nMONTAGUE\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay,\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.\nExeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE\n\nBENVOLIO\nGood-morrow, cousin.\nROMEO\nIs the day so young?\nBENVOLIO\nBut new struck nine.\nROMEO\nAy me! sad hours seem long.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\nBENVOLIO\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\nROMEO\nNot having that, which, having, makes them short.\nBENVOLIO\nIn love?\nROMEO\nOut--\nBENVOLIO\nOf love?\nROMEO\nOut of her favour, where I am in love.\nBENVOLIO\nAlas, that love, so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\nROMEO\nAlas, that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\nHere's much to do with hate, but more with love.\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\nO any thing, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\nMis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,\nsick health!\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nDost thou not laugh?\nBENVOLIO\nNo, coz, I rather weep.\nROMEO\nGood heart, at what?\nBENVOLIO\nAt thy good heart's oppression.\nROMEO\nWhy, such is love's transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\nWith more of thine: this love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;\nBeing purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\nBeing vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:\nWhat is it else? a madness most discreet,\nA choking gall and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz.\nBENVOLIO\nSoft! I will go along;\nAn if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\nROMEO\nTut, I have lost myself; I am not here;\nThis is not Romeo, he's some other where.\nBENVOLIO\nTell me in sadness, who is that you love.\nROMEO\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\nBENVOLIO\nGroan! why, no.\nBut sadly tell me who.\nROMEO\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will:\nAh, word ill urged to one that is so ill!\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\nBENVOLIO\nI aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.\nROMEO\nA right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.\nBENVOLIO\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\nROMEO\nWell, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit\nWith Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;\nAnd, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,\nFrom love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms,\nNor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\nO, she is rich in beauty, only poor,\nThat when she dies with beauty dies her store.\nBENVOLIO\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\nROMEO\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,\nFor beauty starved with her severity\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair:\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead that live to tell it now.\nBENVOLIO\nBe ruled by me, forget to think of her.\nROMEO\nO, teach me how I should forget to think.\nBENVOLIO\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties.\nROMEO\n'Tis the way\nTo call hers exquisite, in question more:\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows\nBeing black put us in mind they hide the fair;\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost:\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair,\nWhat doth her beauty serve, but as a note\nWhere I may read who pass'd that passing fair?\nFarewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.\nBENVOLIO\nI'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\nExeunt\n\nSCENE II.

Come, we burn daylight, ho!\nROMEO\nNay, that's not so.\nMERCUTIO\nI mean, sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\nROMEO\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\nBut 'tis no wit to go.\nMERCUTIO\nWhy, may one ask?\nROMEO\nI dream'd a dream to-night.\nMERCUTIO\nAnd so did I.\nROMEO\nWell, what was yours?\nMERCUTIO\nThat dreamers often lie.\nROMEO\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\nMERCUTIO\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\nAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\nHer wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\nThe traces of the smallest spider's web,\nThe collars of the moonshine's watery beams,\nHer whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,\nHer wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,\nNot so big as a round little worm\nPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\nHer chariot is an empty hazel-nut\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\nTime out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\nO'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,\nO'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,\nO'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\nSometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\nTickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,\nThen dreams, he of another benefice:\nSometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\nOf healths five-fathom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\nAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night,\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\nWhich once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage:\nThis is she--\nROMEO\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\nThou talk'st of nothing.\nMERCUTIO\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\nAnd, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his face to the dew-dropping south.\nBENVOLIO\nThis wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\nROMEO\nI fear, too early: for my mind misgives\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night's revels and expire the term\nOf a despised life closed in my breast\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\nBut He, that hath the steerage of my course,\nDirect my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.\nBENVOLIO\nStrike, drum.\nExeunt\n\nSCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.\nMusicians waiting.

O, he is\nthe courageous captain of compliments. He fights as\nyou sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and\nproportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and\nthe third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk\nbutton, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the\nvery first house, of the first and second cause:\nah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the\nhai!\nBENVOLIO\nThe what?\nMERCUTIO\nThe pox of such antic, lisping, affecting\nfantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,\na very good blade! a very tall man! a very good\nwhore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\ngrandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with\nthese strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these\nperdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,\nthat they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their\nbones, their bones!\nEnter ROMEO\n\nBENVOLIO\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.\nMERCUTIO\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,\nhow art thou fishified!

Thou! why,\nthou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,\nor a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou\nwilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no\nother reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what\neye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\nThy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of\nmeat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as\nan egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a\nman for coughing in the street, because he hath\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:\ndidst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing\nhis new doublet before Easter? with another, for\ntying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou\nwilt tutor me from quarrelling!\nBENVOLIO\nAn I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man\nshould buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\nMERCUTIO\nThe fee-simple!

I beseech thee, youth,\nPut not another sin upon my head,\nBy urging me to fury: O, be gone!\nBy heaven, I love thee better than myself;\nFor I come hither arm'd against myself:\nStay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,\nA madman's mercy bade thee run away.\nPARIS\nI do defy thy conjurations,\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\nROMEO\nWilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!\nThey fight\n\nPAGE\nO Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\nExit\n\nPARIS\nO, I am slain!\nFalls\n\nIf thou be merciful,\nOpen the tomb, lay me with Juliet.\nDies\n\nROMEO\nIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\nMercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!\nWhat said my man, when my betossed soul\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet:\nSaid he not so? or did I dream it so?\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\nI'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;\nA grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.\nLaying PARIS in the tomb\n\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry! which their keepers call\nA lightning before death: O, how may I\nCall this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\nDeath, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty:\nThou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\nAnd death's pale flag is not advanced there.\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\nO, what more favour can I do to thee,\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous,\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that, I still will stay with thee;\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again: here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest,\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\nArms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death!\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!\nHere's to my love!\nDrinks\n\nO true apothecary!\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\nDies\n\nEnter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nSaint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?\nBALTHASAR\nHere's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nBliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\nWhat torch is yond, that vainly lends his light\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,\nIt burneth in the Capel's monument.\nBALTHASAR\nIt doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,\nOne that you love.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nWho is it?\nBALTHASAR\nRomeo.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nHow long hath he been there?\nBALTHASAR\nFull half an hour.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nGo with me to the vault.\nBALTHASAR\nI dare not, sir\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence;\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death,\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nStay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:\nO, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.\nBALTHASAR\nAs I did sleep under this yew-tree here,\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\nAnd that my master slew him.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nRomeo!\nAdvances\n\nAlack, alack, what blood is this, which stains\nThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\nTo lie discolour'd by this place of peace?\nEnters the tomb\n\nRomeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?\nAnd steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\nIs guilty of this lamentable chance!\nThe lady stirs.\nJULIET wakes\n\nJULIET\nO comfortable friar! where is my lord?\nI do remember well where I should be,\nAnd there I am. Where is my Romeo?\nNoise within\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:\nA greater power than we can contradict\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\nAnd Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns:\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming;\nCome, go, good Juliet,\nNoise again\n\nI dare no longer stay.\nJULIET\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\nExit FRIAR LAURENCE\n\nWhat's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end:\nO churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop\nTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips;\nHaply some poison yet doth hang on them,\nTo make die with a restorative.\nKisses him\n\nThy lips are warm.\nFirst Watchman\n[Within] Lead, boy: which way?\nJULIET\nYea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!\nSnatching ROMEO's dagger\n\nThis is thy sheath;\nStabs herself\n\nthere rust, and let me die.\nFalls on ROMEO's body, and dies\n\nEnter Watch, with the Page of PARIS\n\nPAGE\nThis is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.\nFirst Watchman\nThe ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:\nGo, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.\nPitiful sight! here lies the county slain,\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\nWho here hath lain these two days buried.\nGo, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:\nRaise up the Montagues: some others search:\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie;\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\nRe-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR\n\nSecond Watchman\nHere's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.\nFirst Watchman\nHold him in safety, till the prince come hither.\nRe-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE\n\nThird Watchman\nHere is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:\nWe took this mattock and this spade from him,\nAs he was coming from this churchyard side.\nFirst Watchman\nA great suspicion: stay the friar too.\nEnter the PRINCE and Attendants\n\nPRINCE\nWhat misadventure is so early up,\nThat calls our person from our morning's rest?\nEnter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others\n\nCAPULET\nWhat should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\nLADY CAPULET\nThe people in the street cry Romeo,\nSome Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,\nWith open outcry toward our monument.\nPRINCE\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\nFirst Watchman\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\nAnd Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\nWarm and new kill'd.\nPRINCE\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\nFirst Watchman\nHere is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;\nWith instruments upon them, fit to open\nThese dead men's tombs.\nCAPULET\nO heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,--\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!\nLADY CAPULET\nO me! this sight of death is as a bell,\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\nEnter MONTAGUE and others\n\nPRINCE\nCome, Montague; for thou art early up,\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\nMONTAGUE\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;\nGrief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\nPRINCE\nLook, and thou shalt see.\nMONTAGUE\nO thou untaught! what manners is in this?\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\nPRINCE\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,\nAnd know their spring, their head, their\ntrue descent;\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,\nAnd lead you even to death: meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\nDoth make against me of this direful murder;\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\nMyself condemned and myself excused.\nPRINCE\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\nFRIAR LAURENCE\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:\nI married them; and their stol'n marriage-day\nWas Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death\nBanish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth'd and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris: then comes she to me,\nAnd, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,\nA sleeping potion; which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,\nThat he should hither come as this dire night,\nTo help to take her from her borrow'd grave,\nBeing the time the potion's force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stay'd by accident, and yesternight\nReturn'd my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking,\nCame I to take her from her kindred's vault;\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell,\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo:\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth,\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience:\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\nHer nurse is privy: and, if aught in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrificed, some hour before his time,\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\nPRINCE\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?\nBALTHASAR\nI brought my master news of Juliet's death;\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\nAnd threatened me with death, going in the vault,\nI departed not and left him there.\nPRINCE\nGive me the letter; I will look on it.\nWhere is the county's page, that raised the watch?\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\nPAGE\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did:\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\nAnd by and by my master drew on him;\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\nPRINCE\nThis letter doth make good the friar's words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death:\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!\nSee, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.\nAnd I for winking at your discords too\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.\nCAPULET\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand:\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\nMONTAGUE\nBut I can give thee more:\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold;\nThat while Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\nCAPULET\nAs rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity!\nPRINCE\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\nThe sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\nSome shall be pardon'd, and some punished:\nFor never was a story of more woe\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\nExeunt\n"\n
